🧮 Simple Calculator — My First JavaScript Project

This is a simple calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It handles basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I built this as part of my learning journey, and through it, I got to connect everything I’ve been learning — structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript) — into one working project.
🚀 What It Can Do

    Click numbers and math symbols to build a math expression

    Press = to see the result

    Press C to clear the screen

    Shows "Error" if the input is invalid (e.g. 2++)

📚 What I Learned

While building this, I learned more than just making a calculator:
✅ HTML

    How to create and structure a functional layout using buttons and divs

    How to assign onclick events directly to HTML elements

🎨 CSS

    Styling and positioning elements on the screen

    Creating a clean, centered layout

    Adding hover/active effects to improve user experience

🧠 JavaScript

    How to create reusable functions like press(), calculate(), and clearDisplay()

    How eval() works for evaluating expressions (and its risks)

    How to handle errors using try...catch

    How to update the screen with innerText

🔍 How It Works

    press(key) adds the number or symbol to the screen

    calculate() solves the math expression using eval()

    clearDisplay() clears the screen completely

🧪 Sample Test Inputs
User Input	and its subsequent Output:

3 + 2 =	5

8 / 2  =	4

5 * 3  =	15

4 ++ =	Error

Click C	(clears)

💬 Personal Reflection

This was my first hands-on project that brought together everything I've been studying about the web. I now understand how each part of a website connects — from layout to styling to functionality. It may be a simple calculator, but it means a lot to me because it marks the beginning of my project-based learning path.
